Hotshell is a command-line application to efficiently recall and share commands.

Commands are inlaid in interactive single keystroke menus :
  
![demo](images/demo.png)

Try it on the [simulated demo](demos/demo.hs.js.html).

Menus are defined using a JavaScript configuration DSL :

{% highlight javascript %}{% include demo.hs.js %}{% endhighlight %}

Quick tip : Name your definition file `hs.js` and `hs` will pick it up without having to specify a filename.
